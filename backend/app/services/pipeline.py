"""Complete analysis pipeline orchestration.

DATA INTEGRITY GUARANTEE
========================
This pipeline processes ONLY the data the user has explicitly uploaded.

It will NEVER:
  - inject demo assets
  - inject demo performance records
  - silently seed placeholder data
  - add creative IDs that did not come from the user's uploaded CSV
  - generate Creative DNA from placeholder or synthetic features

If no creative assets have been registered, OR if all registered assets are
placeholders (local_demo), the pipeline proceeds with performance analysis only.
Visual feature extraction records Unavailable values for placeholders.
Creative DNA is only generated when at least one REAL Cloudinary image was
successfully analysed.

        Run the complete analysis pipeline.

        Pipeline stages (all 7 are always emitted, even when skipped):
          1. Loading data
          2. Validating data presence
          3. Computing metrics        (on-demand from DB — signals the stage only)
          4. Visual feature extraction (skipped / Unavailable for placeholders)
          5. Running statistical analysis
          6. Building Creative DNA    (only when real Cloudinary features exist)
          7. Finalizing

        DNA generation requires REAL visual features from Cloudinary images.
        Placeholder assets produce Unavailable features and never contribute to DNA.
